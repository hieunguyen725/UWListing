Introduction:
  UW Listing is a database course project that is designed for UW students and staffs to exchange
  items such as books, school tools, eletronic devices, furniture and equipment. It will be taking
  the advantage of the modern web foundation and a database system to provide a better communicating
  system for items exchange. The idea of the system came from an existing Facebook group page "Free
  and For Sale". This Facebook group page has served as a mini-Craigslist for the UW community for 
  several years. To extend to the Facebook page idea, UW Listing will server similar purpose. A system
  containing a database will also help improve items management for the users. It is a way to help the
  users access the items that they need in fast and convenience way. As currently, the system is not
  being introduced yet.

  - Once logged in, a user can create, update, and delete an item.
  - A user can also update their profile and view their reviews.
  
Implementations:
  - The system is currently using a MySQL database 
  - Most of the system is implemented using PHP using a PHP Object Oriented Programming Approach.
